# Library Locker Key Management System

This is a Node.js application for managing the booking and handling of keys in a library locker system. It includes routes for booking keys, retrieving available keys, and managing student key statuses.

## Features

- **Key Booking**: Students can book a key by providing their RFID number. If a key is available, it will be assigned to the student.
- **Key Stack Management**: Keys are managed in a stack (LIFO). The available keys are stored and retrieved in a last-in, first-out order.
- **Student Info**: The system keeps track of the studentâ€™s key booking status.
- **RFID Validation**: The system validates student RFIDs before allowing key bookings.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.

## Requirements

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (running locally or using a cloud service)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your MongoDB connection. Make sure you have a running MongoDB instance. Modify the `RunServer.js` file to connect to your MongoDB database.

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API Routes

### 1. **Root Route** (`GET /`)

Returns the current status of the server.

- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "Status_code": 400,
    "Status": "Locker server run successfully",
    "Author": "Md Arif Ahammed Reza",
    "Contact": "reza35-951@diu.edu.bd"
  }
  ```

### 2. **Book Key** (`POST /api/student/booked-key`)

Allows students to book a key by providing their RFID number. If the key is available, it will be assigned. The system will also manage the camera activation if needed.

- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "data": "student_rfid",
    "key": "optional_key_number"
  }
  ```

- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Key booked successfully!->12345"
  }
  ```

### 3. **Get Available Key Stack** (`GET /api/Locker/stack`)

Returns the list of available keys in the stack.

- **Response:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "Key_ID": "12345",
      "Status": "Available"
    }
  ]
  ```

### 4. **Get Student Info Stack** (`GET /api/student/stack`)

Returns the list of students and their key statuses.

- **Response:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "rfId": "12345",
      "keyStatus": "Taken",
      "TakenKeyNumber": "12345"
    }
  ]
  ```

### 5. **Manage Key Stack** (`POST /api/Locker/key`)

Adds or removes a key from the stack. This route allows administrators to manage keys in the stack.

- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "data": "key_info"
  }
  ```

- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Key added to the stack successfully."
  }
  ```

## Error Handling

The API handles common errors and sends appropriate HTTP status codes and messages:

- **400 Bad Request**: Missing or invalid input data (e.g., missing RFID).
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found (e.g., no keys available, student not found).
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side issues (e.g., database errors, network issues).

## Example Requests

- **Book Key:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/student/booked-key \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"data": "12345"}'
  ```

- **Get Stack of Keys:**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/Locker/stack
  ```

- **Add Key to Stack:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/Locker/key \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"data": {"Key_ID": "12345", "Status": "Available"}}'
  ```
